    This summer I'm working as an undergraduate research assistant at the University of Waterloo, looking into post quantum cryptography with <a href="https://www.douglas.stebila.ca/">Professor Douglas Stebila</a>.

    Last summer (2024) I worked as an undergraduate researcher assistant looking into zero-knowledge proofs under <a href="https://www.pulpspy.com/">Professor Jeremy Clark</a>. Together with Professor Clark and Masters student Youwei Deng, I wrote a <a href="https://www.plonkbook.org">handbook</a> for gadgets in the polynomial interactive oracle proof (Poly-IOP) model used by the succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) Plonk. I also looked at the applications of Plonk-style poly-IOPs for auctions structures such as call markets. I gave a presentation based on my work at the Seminars in Undergraduate Mathematics in Montreal conference. You can check out the slides from it <a href="./pdfs/summSlides.pdf">here</a>.

<p class="bio">
    This summer I'm working as an undergraduate researcher assistant looking into zero-knowledge proofs under <a href="https://www.pulpspy.com/">Professor Jeremy Clark</a>. Together with Professor Clark and Masters student Youwei Deng, I am writing a <a href="https://www.plonkbook.org">handbook</a> for gadgets in the polynomial interactive oracle proof (Poly-IOP) model used by the succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) Plonk. I also looking at the applications of Plonk-style poly-IOPs for proof of solvency as well as implementing call markets.

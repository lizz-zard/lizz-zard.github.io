<p class="bio"> I’m an honours math and computer science student at McGill. 
Currently, I’m doing research with Professor Jeremy Clark on the succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (SNARK) PLONK. Last summer, I interned at the cyber security company Field Effects. Outside of that, I enjoy trivia (with mild success in high school, and now mostly for fun), climbing, and occasionally I write plays. If you’re a McGill student, you should come hang out with McGill’s trivia club Monday and Thursday nights in Trottier. I might be there.  </p>

<p class="bio"> I’m an honours math and computer science student at McGill. I'm interested in topics that lie at the intersection of the two halves of my degree, in particular, cryptography and the algebra that underpins it. This summer I'll be doing cryptographic research with Professor Douglas Stebila, at Waterloo. In the past, I've worked with Professor Jeremy Clark, looking at succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) related to PLONK. Before that, I also interned at the cyber security company Field Effects. Outside of academics, I enjoy trivia (with mild success in high school, and now mostly for fun), climbing, and occasionally I write plays. I have a recreational interest in linguistics, but sadly have failed to fit enough linguistics courses into my degree to earn a minor. </p>
